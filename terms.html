        </div>
        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>
            <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to WAITOS AI SL.</p>
            <p>WAITOS AI SL is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
            <p>CreArt stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that CreArt won’t work properly or at all.</p>
            <p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">AdMob Privacy Policy</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Analytics for Firebase Privacy Policy</a></p>
            <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that WAITOS AI SL will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but WAITOS AI SL cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
            <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
            <p>With respect to WAITOS AI SL’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. WAITOS AI SL accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
            <p>Users own all artworks created by users with assistance of the Service, including all related copyrights and other intellectual property rights (if applicable)</p>
            <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. WAITOS AI SL does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>User Generated Content Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Our application allows users to generate images using AI. While we encourage creativity and exploration, we also have certain guidelines that all users must follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>No Obscene or Offensive Content: Users must not create content that is sexually explicit, violent, discriminatory, illegal, hateful, or otherwise offensive. Any such content will be removed, and the responsible account may be suspended or terminated.</li>
                <li>Respect Others: Users must not generate content that harasses, threatens, or defames others. Content that infringes upon others' rights, including privacy, copyright, and other intellectual property rights, is also not allowed.</li>
                <li>Report Violations: If you encounter content that violates these guidelines, please report it so that we can take appropriate action.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that these guidelines are not exhaustive, and we reserve the right to remove any content we deem inappropriate and to suspend or terminate accounts for serious or repeated violations.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using our application, you agree to these terms and to use the service responsibly.
        </p>
        <h2>IN-APP PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <p>CreArt may include virtual services or tools that can be licensed for a fee, typically via in-app purchase (“Purchased Content”). You may only use the Purchased Content if you are over 18 years old (or of age of legal majority where you live, if different), and only on a limited, personal, nontransferable, nonsublicensable and revocable basis for non-commercial use only. We reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Purchased Content at any time (and in case of subscriptions, after a specified time under terms of a respective subscription). Upon the Purchased Content being available to you (and in case of subscriptions, after the Purchased Content has been available to you for a specified time under terms of a respective subscription), our obligations to provide the Purchased Content are deemed fulfilled, and we make no representation that the Purchased Content will be available to the purchaser for any length of time (otherwise as may be specified in terms of a respective subscription), nor that CreArt will continue to support the Purchased Content (otherwise as may be specified in terms of a respective subscription). SUBJECT TO MANDATORY LEGISLATION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR THE PURCHASED CONTENT FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR THE UNUSED PURCHASED CONTENT, WHETHER YOUR LOSS WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>
            <p>We are unable to view, access, or modify any financial transactions from Apple (as defined below) or Google LLC in-app subscriptions for security and privacy reasons. Instead, we would ask that you reach out to the appropriate support team of Apple or Google LLC in relation to your subscription to request any refunds.</p>
            <p>If made via a Google in-app subscription or purchase, learn more about refunds from Google Play <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
            <p>You can request a refund for an Apple in-app subscription or purchase by following the guidance <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084">here</a>.
